## SHA256 Photo Renamer
This program will be designed to automatically rename all files in a directory to their sha256 hash; for the storage of photos, this will reduce filename collisions significantly.

This is the first commit for this program, and it does not yet accomplish its intended purpose; the next steps in its development will be to add the functionality to scan a given directory and proceed to rename all files in that directory, after the task is confirmed by the user.
